# A repository for college work, help and examples

This repository is mostly self-explanetory for those studying the same course as me, but regardless of if you stumble across this randomly or came here direcly, I hope this helps you in some way, studying, referencing or anything else.

FYI, for those studying software development in my college, most work is based on what's been learned with a few additional things here and there that are important to know IMO. Remember, these are my interpretations of whatever tasks / homework was given, and there are always other ways of writing code that does the exact same thing.

If you want to contribute in any way, don't be afraid to fork this repository, modify or create issues about things I should fix or add, but please keep in mind that it is in fact based around my college course and that contributions / concepts / code too complex should be avoided.
